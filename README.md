# Assignment-on-LSTM
# RMSE calculated over the training and test datasets in comparison to the original dataset

At first, load the dataset ‘monthly_milk_production.csv’ (See the attachment). Go through the code and corresponding texts to understand each step and the interpretation of the final outcome. Reproduce the results successfully.

Now, let us test your understanding of the code on another dataset. Load the dataset 'AirPassengers.csv' (see the attachment). Using LSTM, Solve this regression problem. Given the number of airline passengers (in thousands per month) this month, what is the number of airline passengers (in thousands per month) next month? State your observations on the RMSE calculated over the training and test datasets in comparison to the original dataset.
